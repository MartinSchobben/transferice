The goal of transferice is to reconstruct past oceanographic conditions using fossils. All steps of data selection, model construction, and final predictions are implemented in a `shiny`[@shiny] interface to provide a visual representation of the machine learning pipeline.

## Installation

You can install the development version of transferice from GitHub with devtools:

``` r
# Install tranferice from GitHub: 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UtrechtUniversity/transferice")
```

## Funding

This project was funded by ERC Starting grant number 802835, OceaNice, awarded to Peter Bijl.

## Credits

The construction of the R [@rversion] package *transferice* and associated documentation was aided by the packages; *devtools* [@devtools], *roxygen2* [@roxygen2], *testthat* [@testthat], *knitr* [@knitr2014 ; @knitr2015], *rmarkdown* [@rmarkdown2018; @rmarkdown2020], and the superb guidance in the book: *R packages: organize, test, document, and share your code*, by @Wickham2015. 

Data transformation, cleaning and visualization is performed with: *dplyr* [@dplyr], *tibble* [@tibble], *stringr* [@stringr], and *rlang* [@rlang].

The app is build with *shiny* [@shiny] and the guidance in the book: *Mastering Shiny: Build Interactive Apps, Reports & Dashboards* [@Wickham2020] was a great help in learning how to develop such applications. Furthermore, the packages *shinyjs* [@shinyjs], *shinyWidgets* [@shinyWidgets],  *shinycssloaders* [@shinycssloaders], *bslib* [@bslib] and *thematic* [@thematic] ensure user friendliness and visually pleasing graphics.
